How to send a string on Arduino by Raspi using ROS ?  First of all install ROS and ROSserial on the raspberry pi, and also install the arduino ide .  Now open the ROS through terminal(terminal no.1). After opening the ROS open a new terminal(terminal no.2) and type the following command :   rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/&lt;portName>   : this will create and activate the node for the  subscribers(eg-arduino) now open another terminal(terminal no.3) to publish the data(String in this case) :rostopic pub &lt;topic name> std_msgs/String &lt;"string"> this command will publish the data. The code which I have used to give functionality to arduino is also given here, remember this code should also be uploaded on arduino. NOTE- Note the port number in ide, also keep in mind that we must open new terminal to run ROS command.
